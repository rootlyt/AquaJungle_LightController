<br />Simple, Light-weight Automated Light Controller.
<br />.
<br />You can automate your Aquascape Lamp with ESP-based Microcontroller and some relay or you can even use this as another controller.
<br />.
<br />How To Use:
<br />.
<br /> > buy some 1 channel relay, ESP based Microcontroller ( I use WeMos D1 Mini ESP8266 hehre )
<br />.
<br /> > download the binary firmware/files
<br />.
<br /> > download and use ESPHome Flasher (https://github.com/esphome/esphome-flasher/releases/tag/1.4.0) to upload the firmware / you can use any flasher you want.
<br />.
<br />bad news, I think I've lost the source files, I'll update it if I found it.
