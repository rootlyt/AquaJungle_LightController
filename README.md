Simple, Light-weight Automated Light Controller.
.
You can automate your Aquascape Lamp with ESP-based Microcontroller and some relay or you can even use this as another controller.
.
How To Use:
.
> buy some 1 channel relay, ESP based Microcontroller ( I use WeMos D1 Mini ESP8266 hehre )
> download the binary firmware/files
> download and use ESPHome Flasher (https://github.com/esphome/esphome-flasher/releases/tag/1.4.0) to upload the firmware / you can use any flasher you want.
.
bad news, I think I've lost the source files, I'll update it if I found it.
